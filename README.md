## What it is

### Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, we incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, we are given a static design that lacks accessibility and it's our goal to convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. We also add a service worker so our Web-App it's done with an "offline first" approach.

## Requirements

### From Project [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1090/view)

1. For running the site with a local server, with Python installed (usually present already in GNU and UNIX systems) run in terminal either: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` or `python3 -m http.server 8000`

2. With the server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
